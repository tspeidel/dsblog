<p>Just a few notes for those wondering how I built this site. I’m utilizing R with Yahui’s fantastic package <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a>.</p>

<p>Blogdown utilizes <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> which is a website generator: it compiles a bunch of files so that they can be served in a website. The nice thing about Hugo is that being open source, it has a large community that contribute themes and plugins.</p>
<p>While Hugo has many themes to choose from, I’ve had difficulties finding one that work well with blogdown. In the end, I’ve settled for the popular Academic.</p>

<p>While the blog is managed in R, the files are uoloaded in my GitHub repo. I tried to host the site in GitHub but I found it too cumbersome requiring too many workarounds. Yihui suggested I try <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. I must say that was great advise because it has been a smooth ride: just link Netlify to your GitHub repo, change a couple of settings in Netlify and off you go.</p>
<p>The next phase is to migrate to an RStudio server version I have running on DigitalOcean so that I can publish from anywhere I have internet access. <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a> is a friendly, easy to use VPS. I’ve had RStudio server running on their systems for about 2 years now. If you want to give it a try, click the link below.</p>
