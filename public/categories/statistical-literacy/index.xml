&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time ago I started writing a post on data preparation which I never completed and eventually forgot. A recent LinkedIn post by Kevin Gray stimulated a rich conversation around: “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6352086326745096192&#34;&gt;Can Data Cleaning be automated?&lt;/a&gt;”. It reminded and enticed me to complete the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;data-cleaning-and-data-preparation&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Data Cleaning and Data Preparation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When practitioners talk about data cleaning, they usually refer to a collection of tasks needed to &lt;strong&gt;make the data amenable for analysis&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is not necessarily invalid when we say they need to be cleaned. A common term in statistics that hasn’t fully caught-on in other areas is that of &lt;strong&gt;convenience data&lt;/strong&gt;: data that has been collected for reasons other than the purpose at task. Convenience data includes most of today’s “Big Data” and certainly most data collected for administrative purposes. Convenience data almost always require varying amounts of preparation because &lt;strong&gt;key variables for the task at hand may be missing&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014 on the height of the “Big-Data” hype, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/technology/for-big-data-scientists-hurdle-to-insights-is-janitor-work.html&#34;&gt;Steve Lohr&lt;/a&gt; from the New York Times highlighted what practitioners have known for long time, but that came as a surprise to many. Lohr writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working data scientists spend most of their time preparing data for analysis, a process that includes data collection, assessment, and transformation. Building an analysis data set is the first “hands-on” step in predictive analytics; analysts understand that this task is essntial for effective model building, and they invest as much time as needed to get it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lohr goes on to highlight software tools capable of “finding, cleaning and blending data so that it is ready to be analyzed”. Most practitioners are highly skeptical of such claims; and for good reasons: they fail to recognize the complexity of the task. Unsurprisingly, it appears none of these software tools have caught up with data scientists. But why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;judgment-and-foresight&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Judgment and Foresight&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuhn and Johnson shed some light in their popular book “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Applied-Predictive-Modeling-Max-Kuhn/dp/1461468485&#34;&gt;Applied Predictive Modeling (2013)&lt;/a&gt;”. They write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first steps in the model building process is to transform, or encode, the original data structure into a form that is most informative for the model. This encoding process is critical and must be done with &lt;strong&gt;foresight into the analysis&lt;/strong&gt; that will be performed so that appropriate predictors can be elucidated from the original data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;Foresight into the analysis&lt;/strong&gt;” is the key sentence. Practitioners typically have a reasonable idea of what they are trying to achieve and what they do with the data is a reflection of that purpose. Let me illustrate how that “foresight” affects the choices we make with the data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;table table-striped table-hover table-condensed&#34; style=&#34;float: left; margin-right: 10px;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three data-sets are realizations of the same underlying data, a fictitious customer purchase record. Neither is right or wrong, yet they all represent different “foresight” into how we attempt to analyze the data. There could be hundreds of ways to represent these data and each one of them may address a different analytically objective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;can-data-be-clean&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Can Data Be Clean?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what’s clean data? Notwithstanding data entry errors, it may not exist writes &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mimno.org/articles/carpentry/&#34;&gt;David Mimno (2014)&lt;/a&gt; from Cornell University:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me these imply that there is some kind of pure or clean data buried in a thin layer of non-clean data, and that one need only hose the dataset of to reveal the hard porcelain underneath the muck. In reality, the process is more like deciding how to cut into a piece of material, or how much to plane down a surface. It’s not that there’s any real distinction between good and bad, it’s more that some parts are or knottier than others. &lt;strong&gt;Judgement is critical&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foresight and now judgement&lt;/strong&gt;: two very human traits, both hard to automate except in very narrow problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must also remind ourselves that clean data may not be achievable in the first place. With respect to data with errors, Bill Winkler provides plenty of examples on the complexities of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_linkage&#34;&gt;record linkage&lt;/a&gt; where exact matches may not be feasible to achieve (see &lt;a href=&#34;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wics.1317/abstract&#34;&gt;Winkler, 2014&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Analytics-Methodologies-Driving-Business/dp/0133498603&#34;&gt;Chambers and Dinsmore (2014)&lt;/a&gt; write on the importance of this time consuming steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working data scientists spend most of their time preparing data for analytical a process that includes data collection, assessment, and transformation. Building an analysis data set is the first (hands-on&amp;quot; step in predictive analytics; analysts understand that this task is &lt;strong&gt;essential for effective model building&lt;/strong&gt;, and they invest as much time as needed to get it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;why-the-surprise&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why the Surprise?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For practitioners, it is hardly a surprise data preparation is tedious and time consuming requiring foresight and judgement. Why the surprise then? &lt;a href=&#34;https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~ilyas/&#34;&gt;Ihab Ilyas&lt;/a&gt; a professor at the University of Waterloo explains In a podcast interview on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/why-data-preparation-frameworks-rely-on-human-in-the-loop-systems&#34;&gt;O’Reilly Data Show&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been also difficult to communicate these results to industry. And database practitioners, if you like, they were more into the well structured data and assuming a lot of good properties around this data, [and they were also] more interested in indexing this data, storing it, moving it from one place to another. And now, dealing with this large amount of diverse heterogeneous data with tons of errors, sidled across all business units in the same enterprise became a necessity. You cannot really avoid that anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the problem lies in part with analytically literacy: organizations have traditionally dealt with straight forward analytically needs for which the data at hand was sufficiently usable: &lt;strong&gt;filtering, joining, aggregating, adding, sorting&lt;/strong&gt; etc. For instance: &lt;em&gt;how many widgets were sold in store 11 in Q1 of 2016?&lt;/em&gt; In a typical organization, many inconsistencies of data were carried forward, at times unnoticed, and left to the consumer of the data to deal with. This paradigm no longer holds in the era of data as an asset where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the inconsistencies in the data may preclude more sophisticated analysis and certainly inferential and predictive objectives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the data scientist both prepares and analyzes the data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the data scientist expects to work with raw, unprocessed data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Ilyas and Mimno highlight one aspect of doing data analysis data scientists may struggle with: &lt;strong&gt;single source of the truth&lt;/strong&gt;. This concept helps IT design robust data warehouse systems, but is a misleading principle to adhere to when doing analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;can-data-preparation-be-automated&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Can Data Preparation Be Automated?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my view, the short answer is no. Attempts to automate this tedious and time consuming task have largely failed because we do not know how to address the underlying problem. This does not mean that attempts at &lt;em&gt;facilitating&lt;/em&gt; data preparation tasks have failed. On the contrary, there has been progress in this area. In a &lt;a href=&#34;file:///home/tspeidel/GoogleDrive/dsblog/GitHub/dsblog/content/post/2017-12-30-what-you-aren-t-told-about-data-science.html&#34;&gt;recent Data Skeptic podcast&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft’s Joseph Sirosh reports that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on the latest research in program synthesis (PROSE) and data cleaning, Microsoft created a data wrangling technology that can drastically reduce the time that data scientists have to spend in coding and transforming data for machine learning. The way program synthesis works are, you give an input, the kind of data you want to wrangle, and the output you want to transform to, so you control the before and after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not looked into these tools. Nonetheless, this seems significantly more tractable than auto-magically “&lt;em&gt;finding, cleaning and blending data so that it is ready to be analyzed&lt;/em&gt;”. A search in the academic literature reveals this to be an &lt;a href=&#34;https://scholar.google.ca/scholar?q=program+synthesis+%28PROSE%29+data+transformations&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;amp;as_vis=1&amp;amp;as_ylo=2015&amp;amp;as_yhi=&#34;&gt;active area of research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen whether these tools will become flexible enough for practitioners to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The best past of my job is that, as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/28/us/john-tukey-85-statistician-coined-the-word-software.html?mcubz=0&#34;&gt;John Tukey&lt;/a&gt; famously said, &lt;strong&gt;I get to play in everyone’ sandbox&lt;/strong&gt;. It also brings positive unintended ramifications: we get to cross-pollinate fields. Perhaps, none of this is clearer than how biostatistics helps with &lt;a href=&#34;http://press.anu.edu.au/node/162/download&#34;&gt;policing serious crime in Australia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;policing_resious_crime.jpg&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the authors, Robyn Attewell, writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my statistical perspective is grounded in biostatistics which is the application of statistics in the study of disease and, more generally, the human condition. This is an area in which statistical principles have been well accepted and applied. I do not mean that all doctors know what a chi-square test is or could interpret a logistic regression. However, advances in knowledge in epidemiology and the treatment of disease have occurred through research which has been undertaken with the application of sound statistical methodology. The evidence base for prevention and treatment of disease has moved from personal experience and chronicles of case histories to global randomised controlled trials, longitudinal cohort studies and meta-analyses. The movement within the fields of public health and medicine towards a quantitative evidence base is so strong that the pharmaceutical industry, for example, is very highly regulated. New drug treatments are not able to be registered or receive government subsidy unless supported by a structured compilation of efficacy and safety data. It has to be proven beyond reasonable doubt that new medications work and their positive impact on the target disease outweighs any negatives through adverse side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attewell’s experience mirrors mine (and I bet, that of many other statisticians), having too worked in &lt;a href=&#34;http://epi-research.org/&#34;&gt;biostatistics&lt;/a&gt; for many years and later migrated into energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps not as homogeneous as in other fields - there are indeed isolated pockets of statistical excellence in the energy industry - I routinely come across areas that not only lack statistical principles, but where I perceive a mistrust in something that’s perceived as new and unfamiliar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we over-simplify the statistical methods so that they can be grasped by our audience at the cost of being woefully wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True, statistics and data science aren’t easy and thinking probabilistically is admittedly hard. This presents a challenge for the statistician or the data scientist: do we over-simplify the statistical methods so that they can be grasped by our audience at the cost of being woefully wrong? Do we, instead engage in the daunting task of educating our audience in statistical principles? Or shall we present the finding as unquestionable dogma … hey, just trust the fancy math?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statistics is hard. Multiple regression is hard. Figuring out the appropriate denominator is hard. These errors aren’t so elementary. Andrew Gelman, 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/stephensenn?lang=en&#34;&gt;Stephen John Senn&lt;/a&gt; captures parts of this dilemma when he writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the need for clear results cannot be cited as grounds for only ever using the simplest of techniques. Statistics is no different from other sciences in this respect. Just as we cannot insist that chemist determine pH using litmus paper because that is what the non-chemist remembers from school, so we cannot insist that statisticians restrict themselves to a simple T-test because this was state of the art in 1908.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our colleagues who focus on &lt;strong&gt;machine learning&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;ML&lt;/strong&gt;) face similar dilemmas, perhaps even more so, given that ML methods tend to be uninterpretable &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/news/can-we-open-the-black-box-of-ai-1.20731&#34;&gt;black-boxes&lt;/a&gt;. Two recent papers that touch on this subjects are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kdd.org/kdd2016/papers/files/rfp0573-ribeiroA.pdf&#34;&gt;Ribeiro&lt;/a&gt; et al. and &lt;a href=&#34;http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/risk/library/WPAF201410-AlgorthimAversion-Dietvorst-Simmons-Massey.pdf&#34;&gt;Dietvorst&lt;/a&gt; et al.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ribeiro.png&#34; /&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;dietvorst.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no question in my mind that we need to increase the level of statistical literacy. However, the job of filling the gap left by an educational system that has historically failed to teach statistics cannot be entirely left in the hands of applied statisticians and data scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We teach our children the mathematics of certainty - geometry and trigonometry- but not the mathematics of uncertainty, statistical thinking. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerd_Gigerenzer&#34;&gt;Gert Gigerenzer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-to-do&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What to Do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see very encouraging signs in recent &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics&#34;&gt;STEM&lt;/a&gt; graduates, anecdotally at least, since I see them much better prepared to recognize statistical problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the issue remains for those who have not had a chance to upgrade their skills: &lt;strong&gt;how then, do we increase data and statistical literacy in the current leaders and decision makers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;vendors-consultants-and-hype-make-things-a-lot-harder&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vendors, Consultants (and Hype) Make Things a Lot Harder&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the practicing statistician and data scientist, vendors and consultants are a double edge sword. On one hands they help by bringing to light how statistics, ML (or whatever catchy word du jour is in vogue) can help organizations; because they have a more direct communication channel with upper management, the message makes it to the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, they have little vested interests in educating, let alone provide a fair view of the landscape. And in the long run, this is damaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, none of this damage is clearer than what’s happening with IBM Watson in health care where the “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.technologyreview.com/s/607965/a-reality-check-for-ibms-ai-ambitions/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;unrealistic timelines or promises&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” are now becoming obvious and, perhaps, backfiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not too worried about health care where the unrealistic claims are usually met with a dismissive shrug, precisely because, as Attewel writes, statistical principles have been well accepted and applied in that field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But think about areas where statistical principles are not nearly as pervasive. Lack of statistical literacy, means our defense mechanism is unprepared. Instead, the receiver has to rely on faulty heuristics and anecdotes such as: “&lt;em&gt;I heard SmartCo is using this tool, so it must be good&lt;/em&gt;” with little science to back them up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With time, the organization realizes those promises never materialized, the claims were unrealistic, and preconceived notions are re-inforced after a brief hiatus of hope. In a field where there are no certain truths, it’s easy to throw away the baby with the bathwater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;summary&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data Science and Statistics, including more specialized branches, such as biostatistics, have wide applicability in many analytical problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Statistical literacy and critical thinking present a gap that is easily exploited&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to do a better job at educating people unfamiliar with data science and statistics, but this cannot be left entirely in the hands of the practitioner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>10 Big Data Myths</title>
      <link>/post/10-big-data-myths.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 25 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/10-big-data-myths.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone seems to like top-10 lists and many organizations are interested in Big Data, so it seems timely to write my own top 10 list on Big Data. A premise is warranted. Those who know me, know how much I ditest the term “Big Data”. Yet, for good or worse, Big Data is here to stay and so it’s important that we try clarify what it is and it isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;see &lt;a href=&#34;https://dzone.com/articles/10-big-data-myths-exploded&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;https://dzone.com/articles/10-big-data-myths-exploded&lt;/a&gt; Gartner: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.forbes.com/sites/gartnergroup/2013/03/27/gartners-big-data-definition-consists-of-three-parts-not-to-be-confused-with-three-vs/#30da54dd42f6&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/gartnergroup/2013/03/27/gartners-big-data-definition-consists-of-three-parts-not-to-be-confused-with-three-vs/#30da54dd42f6&lt;/a&gt; Diego slides: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.slideshare.net/kuonen/the-power-of-data-insights-big-data-as-the-fuel-and-analytics-as-the-engine-of-the-digital-transformation&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;https://www.slideshare.net/kuonen/the-power-of-data-insights-big-data-as-the-fuel-and-analytics-as-the-engine-of-the-digital-transformation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/how-to-call-bullshit-on-big-data-a-practical-guide&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/how-to-call-bullshit-on-big-data-a-practical-guide&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://hbr.org/2016/11/what-artificial-intelligence-can-and-cant-do-right-now&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;https://hbr.org/2016/11/what-artificial-intelligence-can-and-cant-do-right-now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-is-big-data&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is Big Data?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First thing first: definitions. What is Big Data? The hardest thing about Big Data is defining it. Conventionally, Big Data is defined in terms of the 3 or 4 V’s:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volume&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Velocity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Variety&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Veracity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an overview of each V, I refer you to Diego Kuonen’s excellent [slides] here(&lt;a href=&#34;https://image.slidesharecdn.com/pdibddsmlmsftfeb12017-170201151005/95/the-power-of-data-insights-big-data-as-the-fuel-and-analytics-as-the-engine-of-the-digital-transformation-9-638.jpg?cb=1485961990&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;https://image.slidesharecdn.com/pdibddsmlmsftfeb12017-170201151005/95/the-power-of-data-insights-big-data-as-the-fuel-and-analytics-as-the-engine-of-the-digital-transformation-9-638.jpg?cb=1485961990&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;myths-facts&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Myths &amp;amp; Facts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big Data will enable analytics within the organization. Not necessarily. You don’t need Big Data to become more analytically mature. Many organizations have become analytically astute without Big Data. For instance, look at CERN, Capital One, Wal-Mart, AT&amp;amp;T. As friend Diego Kuonen writes, &lt;strong&gt;Big Data is mostly a data management infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt; problem, and less an analytical one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big Data provides a single source of the truth. No. As a long time analytics practitioner, I’ve always struggled with the idea of single source of the truth, which I recognize as being a useful ideal in designing data systems. But when it comes to making sense of data, it is common to have multiple sources of the truth. It all depends on the question one is trying to answer. Consider the trivial reporting of some metric for regulatory compliance vs. reporting for business improvement processes. The two metrics may be given the same name, they may involve the same calculations, but they may come from different systems designed for different purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big Data will make access to data easier No, or not yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big Data is synonym of HADOOP Yes. While it is true that there are other standards, tools and technologies, the majority of the Big Data ecosystems are either based on HADOOP or strongly influenced by it. Big Data is becoming a substitute for HADOOP, Apache and any project revolving around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Big Data and AI, organizations will no longer need Data Scientists, Data Engineers No. I’m told similar things were said in the past for coders and the demand has only increased ever since. Data does not automagically analyze itself, no matter how much AI you inject. Let’s not confuse automatable tasks with the myth of self-learning, eloquently summarized by &lt;a href=&#34;https://hbr.org/2016/11/what-artificial-intelligence-can-and-cant-do-right-now&#34;&gt;Andrew Ng&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;If a typical person can do a mental task with less than one second of thought, we can probably automate it using AI either now or in the near future.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With more data the task of organizing, curating, identifying, and preparing the data for analysis can only increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;6&#34; style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users will be able to interact with Big Data more easily I have no evidence of this, but I speculate that accessing data will be harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The More the Data, the Better False. Maybe that’s true for the NSA (though even for them, I have some doubts). But most organizations do not have the deep pockets of a secretive government organization. Predictive models are usually built on samples: seldom is the whole data ever needed. There are also problems with having too large of a dataset, that to this day, we have not quite solved yet. Curse of large numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open Source is key for Big Data True. When one looks at the building blocks of most Big Data technology, they will soon realize it’s an ocean of open source initiatives without which we probably would not be having this conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>One Common Mistake Data Analysts Make and How to Avoid It</title>
      <link>/post/one-common-mistake-data-analysts-make-and-how-to-avoid-it.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/one-common-mistake-data-analysts-make-and-how-to-avoid-it.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One common mistake inexperienced analyst do in analysing data is that of &lt;strong&gt;assigning a special role to time&lt;/strong&gt;. In my line of work, I see this a lot. Signs of &lt;em&gt;chronophrenia&lt;/em&gt;, a term I just made up, are the unusual focus on calendar time: from line plots of multiple variables on the y-axis against time on the x-axis, to frequencies or averages by some meaningful time cut-off: monthly, quarterly, yearly and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, I think there are plenty of scenarios when looking at time makes perfect sense and both the statistical, engineering and econometric literature continue to make substantial contributions to this area (I can think of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_detection&#34;&gt;change point detection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter&#34;&gt;Kalman filters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9780387772370-c1.pdf?SGWID=0-0-45-771009-p173891512&#34;&gt;Bayesian/Dynamic time series&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often the analyst attempts to visually assess whether a &lt;strong&gt;shift in time exists&lt;/strong&gt;. The hope is that the shift can be tied to a special cause known to the analyst (for instance a change that was introduced at known point in time) and that this would represent evidence in favour or against a hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of drawbacks with this approach. Here I will list a few common ones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we know whether a change in time is due to some special cause that happens at a know time, or whether is due to normal variation? In these settings SPC is limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time does not possess magical properties: in most fields, seldom is time on the causal pathway. In other words, time does not cause much. Ok, there are some exceptions, however, at best, time is a proxy measure for something we are unable to measure. Think about it: how many times can we think of time having caused something? Death? Not really: trauma, or the inability of cells to reproduce reliably are some of the underlying causes. An old engine breaking down? Think fatigue, structural failure, wear and tear. Changing jobs? Think of complex social issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once you do fully understand a process, time plays no role (Cleves et al.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose we introduce some change at a known point in time. The analyst proceeds to compare, often visually, whether a slope or a shift change occurs. The approach is limited unless we can somehow freeze everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To an untrained analyst, time is an open invitation to slice and dice the data until some interesting results are found: we will always find a reason for looking at things daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly. These are in fact, meaningful measures to a lot of businesses. Eventually, you are guaranteed to find something interesting or even significant. But it does not mean it’s true. But wait! Don’t take my word for it! &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations&#34;&gt;Tyler Vigen&lt;/a&gt; assembled a very humorous collection of &lt;strong&gt;spurious correlations&lt;/strong&gt;. Vigen had enough material to fill a whole book. You don’t have to buy his book, though I would encourage you to do so. Some are available on Vigen’s website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visualization pioneer Edward Tufte has a very effective visual demonstration on &lt;strong&gt;streak-guessing&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;over-narrative&lt;/strong&gt; around time (here, adapted from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001OR&#34;&gt;original&lt;/a&gt;). On the top figure we see the actual win-loss record. At the bottom, notice what happens when we randomize the order on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;winning_streak_1.png&#34; /&gt; &lt;em&gt;2009 Boston Red Sox win-loss record: when 4 or more wins occurs one after the other, the series is drawn in red. The causal attribution of win or loss streaks result in over-narratives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;winning_streak_2.png&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not so fast: 3 randomized samples from the same data. There is little evidence for a causal mechanism of win or loss streaks that in the original series resulted in over-narratives. The invisible hand of chance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, enough about ranting against time. Let me play devil’s advocate and list some arguments in favour of time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we do not understand a process, time is often a good proxy for something we are unable to measure. We should try to smooth time to detect trends. I’m a fan of LOESS for its flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;loess.gif&#34; alt=&#34;LOESS&#34; /&gt; LOESS (image from &lt;a href=&#34;https://simplystatistics.org/2017/08/08/code-for-my-educational-gifs/&#34;&gt;Simply Statistics&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Survival analysis (time to event analysis) is mostly concerned with the rate at which things are moving. Is a certain group reaching an event faster than another group? Survival analysis can effectively deal with survivorship bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we introduce a change at a given time point, there are methods that try to deal with it, such as interrupted time series or &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_detection&#34;&gt;change point detection&lt;/a&gt; (these can go by different names). For an overview, see Kontopantelis. Change point detection is an active area of research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are embarking on an analysis, don’t jump on time as your first go-to measure. Think carefully about the problem and try first to identify all factors that may affect a response of interest. Explore those first, plot them against the response, plot them against each other. Try to learn as much about your problem without recurring to time immediately. When you do look at time, remember there are challenges unique to times that complicates things (autocorrelation and censoring to name a couple).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember: “&lt;em&gt;Once you do fully understand a process, time plays no role&lt;/em&gt;” … or almost.&lt;/p&gt;
